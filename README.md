CSSE/MA 473 Design &amp; Analysis of Algorithms Project: ConvexHull
<br>
<h3>Instructions on how to open project</h3>
1. Make sure your Node.js is updated
2. In command line, go to root directory of project ./CSSE-MA473-ConvexHull
3. Type "npm install"
4. Everything needed should now be installed properly
5. Type "npm start"
6. In a browser, go to "localhost:8000/" and it should take you to the Convex Hull page

<h3>How to add your own input to project</h3>
Create a .txt file with any number of points in the same style as the other files already there.<br>
Add text file in the /app/files/ folder where the others are located.<br>
Now you are able to type the name of the file on the webpage to load it.

<h3>Where to look for implementation</h3>
1. ./screenshots/ folder contains the required screenshots.
2. ./ConvexHullTimeAnalysis.pdf is where I summarize & analyze my timing result. Also includes graphs with an attemp at the best fit function.
3. ./honestyStatement contains my brief statement that I did not share code.
4. ./app/main.css is where all my styling code is located.
5. ./app/views/convexHull.html is the webpage components.
6. ./app/files/ is the folder where all the text file inputs of points are located.
7. ./app/controllers/convexHull.js contains the controller and JavaScript code that implements the algorithms and everything else.
